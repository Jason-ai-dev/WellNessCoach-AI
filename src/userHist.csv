Josh,"This session with Josh started with positive feedback regarding a successful presentation.  However,  subtle shifts in his demeanor revealed underlying concerns that remained largely unexpressed.  Despite attempts to elicit more information, Josh's responses were vague and cryptic (""buy now,"" ""sign up,"" ""value""), suggesting possible anxieties related to a marketing or sales context connected to his presentation's success. The session concluded with unresolved issues requiring further exploration in future sessions.
"
Simon,"This discussion reviewed a previous session with a client, Mike, who expressed distress using the vague phrase ""just doesn't.""  The focus was on identifying ways to improve the counselor's response by encouraging Mike to elaborate further on his feelings and experiences,  thus fostering a deeper understanding of his needs.
"
Ahmed,"The session with Ahmed involved significant shifts in his emotional expression, ranging from surprise and happiness to fear and anger.  He experienced periods of silence, indicating difficulty in expressing himself verbally.  The focus was on creating a safe and non-judgmental space, allowing him to process his emotions at his own pace.  The session ended with Ahmed still experiencing fear, but in a safe environment where he can continue processing and, hopefully, eventually communicate.
